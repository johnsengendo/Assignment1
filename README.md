# Assignment

In this repository, I use COMNETSEMU to simulate a video stream between a client and a server, where I stream the video and I capture the packets of the vedio being streamed.
To run the script, I first set up the client host and the server host, and within the hosts, I build Docker images, both at the client and at the server, which perform the streaming. 
To run the script, I have the Topology.py script which sets up the topology. With in this script, I set-up the hosts which are connected by 2 sitches. 
Further more, the script calls for the building of the images, and further, video streaming is performed.
